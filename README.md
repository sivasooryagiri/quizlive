## 🚀 Getting Started

Pick the setup that fits your situation:

| Method | Best for | Cost |
|--------|----------|------|
| [🏠 Local + Private Network](docs/deploy-local.md) | Classroom, office, events on same Wi-Fi | $0 — truly free |
| [☁️ AWS EC2](docs/deploy-aws.md) | Public quiz, full control, your own server | ~$0 free tier |
| [🔥 Firebase + Vercel](docs/deploy-free.md) | Easiest cloud setup, up to 100 players free | $0 up to 100 players |
| [🐳 Docker](docs/deploy-docker.md) | Self-hosted, clean environment | $0 |

> **On Firebase costs:** Firebase is the database. Free tier covers up to ~100 simultaneous players. Beyond that, Blaze pay-as-you-go kicks in — roughly $5–7/month for 500 players at 3 sessions/day. You control your own Firebase project and billing. For local or AWS setups, costs depend only on your own server.

### ⚡ Quickstart (localhost)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivasooryagiri/quizlive.git
cd quizlive
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill in your Firebase config
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`

> Full Firebase setup guide → [docs/deploy-local.md](docs/deploy-local.md)

cp .env.example .env

```

Open `http://localhost:3000`

## 🗺️ Pages

| Path | Access | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `/` | Open — no login needed | Join and answer on their phones |
| `/host` | Open — meant for the projector/big screen | Live question display, timer, leaderboard |
| `/admin` | Admin password required | Questions, game control, history, QR toggle |
| `/about` | Open — no login needed | About the project and builder |

---

## 👥 Capacity

All deployments use Firebase Firestore as the database — capacity depends on your Firebase plan, not where the frontend is hosted.

| Firebase plan | Concurrent players | Cost |
|---------------|--------------------|------|
| Spark (free) | ~80–100 | $0 |
| Blaze (pay-as-you-go) | 500+ | ~$5–7/month at heavy use (3 sessions/day, 500 players) |

> The frontend host (Local / Docker / AWS / Vercel) only serves static files — it has no real player limit. The bottleneck is always Firestore concurrent connections.

---

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Frontend** — React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Database** — Firebase Firestore (real-time listeners)
- **Auth** — Firebase Authentication (admin), no player accounts
- **Hosting** — Vercel (or self-hosted)
- **Charts** — Recharts (answer bar chart)
- **QR** — qrcode.react

---

## ⚖️ License & use

Open source. Free to use, modify, and self-host.

**Not for commercial or monetary use.** Do not sell access, charge players, bundle into a paid product, or use as a revenue-generating service. Built to make quizzes free and accessible — keep it that way.

Personal use, education, internal events, community quizzes — all fine.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap

Things planned or worth building next:

**🎨 Presentation themes**
Multiple visual themes for the host/projector screen — dark, light, high-contrast, branded. Selectable per session from the admin panel.

**💬 Room mood / word cloud**
Players type any word during a session. Words appear as floating bubbles on the host screen — the more a word is typed, the bigger its bubble. A lightweight way to feel the room before or between questions.

**More ideas worth adding**
- [ ] 🖼️ Image questions — attach an image to a question
- [ ] 👥 Team mode — group players into teams, score aggregated
- [ ] 🔢 Custom scoring — let admin set points per question
- [ ] ⏱️ Timed lobby — auto-start after countdown
- [ ] 📥 Question import — paste a JSON or CSV to bulk-add questions
- [ ] 🔔 Webhook on session end — post results to Slack, Discord, or a URL

---

## 🔍 Use cases

- 🏫 **Teachers** — run classroom quizzes, no Kahoot subscription needed
- 🏢 **Teams** — replace Slido for internal events and town halls
- 🎉 **Events** — trivia nights, conferences, community meetups
- 🖥️ **Self-hosters** — full control, runs on your own hardware
- 🌐 **Offline use** — works on a local network with no internet
