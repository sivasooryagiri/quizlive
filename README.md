# 🎯 QuizLive

**Free. Open source. Fully yours.**

A real-time multiplayer quiz app — like Kahoot or Slido, but without the paywall, the account wall, or the vendor deciding what you can do with it. Run it on a laptop, share it over Wi-Fi, or deploy it to the cloud. Your call.

- **Frontend** — React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Database** — Firebase Firestore (real-time listeners)
- **Auth** — Password-protected admin (env var), no player accounts
- **Hosting** — Vercel (or self-hosted)
- **Charts** — Recharts (answer bar chart)

---

## ⚖️ License & use

Open source. Free to use, modify, and self-host.

**Not for commercial or monetary use.** Do not sell access, charge players, bundle into a paid product, or use as a revenue-generating service. Built to make quizzes free and accessible — keep it that way.

Personal use, education, internal events, community quizzes — all fine.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap

Things planned or worth building next:

**🎨 Presentation themes**
Multiple visual themes for the host/projector screen — dark, light, high-contrast, branded. Selectable per session from the admin panel.

**💬 Room mood / word cloud**
Players type any word during a session. Words appear as floating bubbles on the host screen — the more a word is typed, the bigger its bubble. A lightweight way to feel the room before or between questions.

**More ideas worth adding**
- [ ] 🖼️ Image questions — attach an image to a question
- [ ] 👥 Team mode — group players into teams, score aggregated
- [ ] 🔢 Custom scoring — let admin set points per question
- [ ] ⏱️ Timed lobby — auto-start after countdown
- [ ] 📥 Question import — paste a JSON or CSV to bulk-add questions
- [ ] 🔔 Webhook on session end — post results to Slack, Discord, or a URL
