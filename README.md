## How to run it

Pick the setup that fits your situation:

### [Local machine + private network](docs/deploy-local.md)
Run on your laptop and share with everyone on the same Wi-Fi. Best for classrooms, offices, or events where you control the network. No internet required.

### [AWS EC2 — public internet](docs/deploy-aws.md)
Host on a public IP using AWS free tier. Anyone with the link can join from anywhere. Good for remote events or public quizzes.

### [Firebase + Vercel — free cloud hosting](docs/deploy-free.md)
The easiest path to a live public URL at $0 cost. Handles 80–100 simultaneous players on the free tier (Spark plan allows 100 concurrent Firestore connections). Questions and total player count are unlimited — the only real ceiling is concurrent active connections.

## About

Built for fun when a friend couldn't find a quiz app that was actually free and usable.

The whole point is that you decide how to run it — local, private network, or public cloud. Simple UI, quick to set up, works for any audience.
