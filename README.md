- 🖥️ Host screen runs on the projector — live answer chart, timer, leaderboard podium
- 🎛️ Admin panel controls everything — questions, game flow, QR toggle, session history
- ⚡ Scores are time-weighted — faster correct answers earn more, computed from answers so they can't be tampered with ([how scoring & ranking work →](SCORING.md))

## 🚀 Getting Started

Pick the setup that fits your situation:

| Method | Best for | Where it runs |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| [🔥 **Firebase + Vercel** ⭐ *Recommended*](docs/deploy-free.md) | **Easiest cloud setup, no server to manage** | **Vercel CDN (global, fast)** |
| [🏠 Local + Private Network](docs/deploy-local.md) | Classroom, office, events on same Wi-Fi | Your laptop |
| [☁️ AWS EC2](docs/deploy-aws.md) | Public quiz, full control, your own server | AWS instance |
| [🐳 Docker](docs/deploy-docker.md) | Self-hosted, clean environment | Any container host |

> 📖 **Docs:** [Scoring & Ranking](SCORING.md) · [Security & Threat Model](SECURITY.md) · [Firebase Costs](FIREBASE-COSTS.md)

> ⭐ **Recommended:** **Firebase + Vercel CDN** — zero servers to babysit, global CDN, free up to ~80–100 concurrent players. **This is the only setup we've tested end-to-end.** The Local / AWS / Docker paths should work (same code, just different host) but we haven't run them ourselves — your mileage may vary.

> **All four use Firebase Firestore as the real-time database** — that part is the same everywhere. Firebase's free tier comfortably covers normal use (~80–100 concurrent players). For larger events or detailed pricing → [FIREBASE-COSTS.md](FIREBASE-COSTS.md).

### ⚡ Quickstart (localhost)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivasooryagiri/quizlive.git
cd quizlive
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# fill in your Firebase config
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`

> ⚠️ **Two manual steps in Firebase Console you must do, or login + security won't work:**
> 1. **Auth** → add user with email **`admin@quizlive.internal`** (this email is hardcoded — see [LoginScreen.jsx:16](src/components/admin/LoginScreen.jsx)) + your chosen password
> 2. **Firestore → Rules** tab → paste the contents of [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) → Publish
>
> Full Firebase setup guide → [docs/deploy-local.md](docs/deploy-local.md)

## 👥 Capacity

**QuizLive itself is $0 — always.** No license, no subscription, no per-player fee. Code is yours, free forever.

The only moving part with a meter on it is **Firebase Firestore** (the real-time database). Google runs Firebase, not QuizLive — so any database cost goes directly to your own Firebase project, not to us.

- ✅ **Firebase free tier (Spark)** handles **~80–100 concurrent players** at $0/month — fits classrooms, small offices, community quizzes, most events.
- 📈 If you outgrow that (hundreds of players, dozens of sessions/day), you'd switch your Firebase project to the pay-as-you-go plan.

> Heavy usage? Hosting hundreds of players or running this for a big organization? **Read [FIREBASE-COSTS.md](FIREBASE-COSTS.md)** for the full breakdown — free-tier sessions per day by player count × question count, paid pricing bands, and how to set a budget cap so you never get a surprise bill.

## 🛠️ Tech stack

- **Frontend** — React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Database** — Firebase Firestore (real-time listeners)
- **Auth** — Firebase Authentication (admin), no player accounts
- **Hosting** — Vercel (or self-hosted)
- **Charts** — Recharts (answer bar chart)
- **QR** — qrcode.react

---

## ⚖️ License & use

Open source. Free to use, modify, and self-host.

**Not for commercial or monetary use.** Do not sell access, charge players, bundle into a paid product, or use as a revenue-generating service. Built to make quizzes free and accessible — keep it that way.

Personal use, education, internal events, community quizzes — all fine.

---

## 🗓️ Roadmap

Things planned or worth building next:

**🎨 Presentation themes**
Multiple visual themes for the host/projector screen — dark, light, high-contrast, branded. Selectable per session from the admin panel.

**💬 Room mood / word cloud**
Players type any word during a session. Words appear as floating bubbles on the host screen — the more a word is typed, the bigger its bubble. A lightweight way to feel the room before or between questions.

**More ideas worth adding**
- [ ] 🖼️ Image questions — attach an image to a question
- [ ] 👥 Team mode — group players into teams, score aggregated
- [ ] 🔢 Custom scoring — let admin set points per question
- [ ] ⏱️ Timed lobby — auto-start after countdown
- [ ] 📥 Question import — paste a JSON or CSV to bulk-add questions
- [ ] 🔔 Webhook on session end — post results to Slack, Discord, or a URL
